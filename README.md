# PXScript
PXScript is a modern, web-focused programming language inspired by JavaScript and TypeScript. Its goal is to provide developers with a simple, readable syntax while supporting optional static typing for safer code. PXScript code can be compiled to JavaScript, making it runnable directly in browsers or Node.js environments.
